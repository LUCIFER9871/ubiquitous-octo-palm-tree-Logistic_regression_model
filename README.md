## Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project
.This project develops a machine learning model to predict passenger survival from the historic sinking of the RMS Titanic sinking. Using passenger demographic and travel information, the model identifies patterns that influenced survival outcomes.

Dataset source: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The dataset contains passenger information with the following key features:

PassengerId – Unique ID

Pclass – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex – Male/Female

Age

SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch – Number of parents/children aboard

Fare

Embarked – Port of embarkation

Survived – Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
